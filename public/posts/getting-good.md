# Becoming a better engineer

As someone that only started writing code in their early 20s, building scrappy Python scripts and stitching together side-projects, meant I could write code but would never consider myself to be a great engineer. 

I came across two videos that have inspired me to act on this goal. They're a great waych, but I've included my main takeaways:


1. [Mindset of Successful Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS19Q-_saCc)

> It takes 10,000 lines of codes to master a language 

Malcolm Gladwell famously said that it takes 10,000 hours to master a complex skill. In programming, this can be thought of as 10,000 lines of code (where every 1000 lines is more efficient than the last).


1. [This is Why Programming Is Hard For you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS19Q-_saCc)

> Imagine learning to cook, but youâ€™ve only remembered the steps but not the principles behind them.

This is the same within programming - programming =/= coding. Simply memorising the syntax of a language doesn't teach you the programmer's mindset - this is where I'll be focusing my efforts. 

> It's not knowing HOW to code, it's about knowing WHAT to code.

## Actions I'll be taking

1. Mastering one language - for me this will be Python. 
2. Read > Build > Learn. I'll be taking the actions on building, failing and learning and actively avoiding relying on reading or videos.
3. Keep pushing forward!
